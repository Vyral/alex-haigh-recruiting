If you’re an independent agent looking to join a brokerage, which brokerage should you go with? What makes brokerages different from each other? I’ve been in the real estate business for 15 years, and I’ve learned many prudent lessons from my father, who was also a longtime agent, so I can tell you that the answer boils down to value and opportunity. To that end, there are four points you must consider before making a decision.&nbsp;

Following along in the video above to see me break down these four points in depth and explain why they matter. **For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps so you can skip ahead to various sections:&nbsp;**

1:09—What is the structure of the brokerage you’re considering?

2:56—What type of training/mentorship do they offer?&nbsp;

5:03—Where systems and ownership come into play

6:15—There is no “magic” company—it all comes down to you&nbsp;

7:18—The customer is the most important factor&nbsp;

7:54—Wrapping things up

If you’d like to talk more about this topic or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;
