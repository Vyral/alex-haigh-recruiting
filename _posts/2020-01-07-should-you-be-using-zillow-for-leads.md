I’ve done a lot of online advertising over the years, and one of the most successful platforms I’ve used is Zillow. I’ve been doing this for about a decade now, so today I wanted to share some of my expertise by answering some common questions about advertising on Zillow and giving you a peek behind the curtain of the platform’s evolution.

**Here’s an outline of my discussion, with timestamps, so that you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you most:**

1:15 - Are Zillow leads good?&nbsp;

4:10 - A key statistic to help you understand the general effectiveness of online leads

5:15 - Why are Zillow leads a bit pricier than most?

6:05 - The two categories that I separate my Zillow leads into

11:01 - Why I won’t buy a Zillow lead without 30% market share on Zillow ads

12:20 - The kind of ROI that I look for in my Zillow leads

13:55 - Why I’m actually moving away from Zillow leads these days

14:45 - Wrapping things up

If you have any questions for me about anything I discussed in today’s video or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
