&nbsp;

We were staggered to see the numbers from the April 2020 market as they compared to 2019. Here’s what we mean:

**St. Lucie County:**

* Closed sales: -11.3%
* Paid in cash: +1.9%
* Average sale price: +2.4%
* Dollar volume: -9.2%
* New listings: -25.4%
* Pending sales: -34.7%
* Month supply of inventory: -16.3%

**Martin County:**

* Closed sales: -25.2%
* Paid in cash: -41.7%
* Average sale price: -3.7%
* Dollar volume:-28.1%
* New listings: -40.2%
* Pending sales: -49.8
* Month supply of inventory: -14.3%

**Palm Beach County:**

* Closed sales: -37.8%
* Paid in cash: -47.3%
* Average sale price: +6%
* Dollar volume: -34.1%
* New listings: -43.7%
* Pending sales: -46%
* Month supply of inventory: -3.5%

For the moment, we’re still a neutral market, but if the numbers continue to trend like this, we’ll definitely be heading toward a buyer’s market.&nbsp; If you have any questions about our real estate market trends, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.
