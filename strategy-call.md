<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Alex Haigh and here at The Haigh Group, we have sold thousands of homes. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I will also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners or homebuyers who will list or purchase their home with you. </p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">"Since joining The Haigh Group, I have grown professionally and have tremendous support.  Alex is a great lead by example Team Leader.  He has gone above and beyond to provide a great team environment.  We have all the tools for success at our fingertips from a great lead gen system to the administrative support of our operations manager and transaction coordinator.  I am challenged to take my goals to the next level and encouraged every step along the way."</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">"Everyone is very informative and helpful with the processes. I appreciate everyone’s help. Thank you."</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">"Eighteen months ago I changed careers and entered real estate. Joined another brokerage and got some great initial training but spent a year grinding and spinning my wheels. I had the work ethic but no experience or guidance and started looking for someone who was a market leader and was willing to coach a new agent. Alex took a chance on me: my first year in real estate I made a whopping $0. I did have work ethic and desire to do whatever I had to do to be successful - and Alex gave me the opportunity to prove myself. I joined Alex 5 months ago and was under contract within my first 30 days. Since then I've not only closed multiple transactions but have a full pipeline and on track to hit my goal. I've gotten amazing experience - from BPOs to 1st time home buyers to luxury properties. I've worked with investors buying everything from land to multi-family property. Every day I'm encouraged to move out of my comfort zone and grow. I've got phenomenal support from Alex and our team and am surrounded by a group who continually holds me to a higher level of accountability. Wake up every day loving every minute of what I do!"</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">"Since joining the Haigh Group and using the systems Alex has in place I have more than doubled my production and been more consistent with leads.  Without the Haigh Group I would be scrounging like I was for years to get a buyer or listing just to keep my business going."</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team or brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete it before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Alex Haigh</p>
