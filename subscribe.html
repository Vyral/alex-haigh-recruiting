<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in The Treasure Coast of Florida?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you; which include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 12,099 homes sold in the greater The Treasure Coast of Florida market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell 106 homes last year.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</ol></p>

<p>…I invite you to subscribe to our free newsletter below.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Since joining The Haigh Group, I have grown professionally and have tremendous support. Alex is a great lead by example Team Leader. He has gone above and beyond to provide a great team environment. We have all the tools for success at our fingertips from a great lead gen system to the administrative support of our operations manager and transaction coordinator. I am challenged to take my goals to the next level and encouraged every step along the way." <span class="testimonial-author">- Dawn Byrd</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Everyone is very informative and helpful with the processes. I appreciate everyone’s help. Thank you." <span class="testimonial-author">- Jeanette McClaskey</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Since joining the Haigh Group and using the systems Alex has in place I have more than doubled my production and been more consistent with leads. Without the Haigh Group I would be scrounging like I was for years to get a buyer or listing just to keep my business going." <span class="testimonial-author">- Lenee Ladas</span></p>
